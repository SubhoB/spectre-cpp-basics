## Lesson 4
  - Template wrap-up: SpatialVector of DataVector
    - Clean-up and test SpatialVector<double>
      - Start with last time's SpatialVector code
      - Rename to SpatialVector.hpp, remove main()
      - Add container to_string()
      - Add SpatialVector to_string()
      - In new SpatialVector.cpp, print out dot product of vector of doubles in 2D
    - Draw the idea of a grid and our 1D representation
      - valarray as DataVector stand-in
      - In SpatialVector.cpp, make DataVectors to loop over points of a grid in 2D
      - In SpatialVector.cpp, make a spatial vector of the coordinates
      - In SpatialVector.cpp, print the dot product
      - In SpatialVector.cpp, print out a gaussian in 2D
  - Lambdas and functors
    - Revisit trapezoid integrator
      - Template on type instead of taking a function pointer
      - Pass in a function
      - Pass in a functor (struct with operator() const member function)
      - Pass in a lambda
  - Lambdas continued
    - Start with a simple print_container<T>() function
    - std::iota to make a list of doubles
    - apply_math_op closure that squares data in place
    - power, pow, as an example of lambda capture
    - const lambdas can't modify captures
  - Intro to metaprogramming: TaggedTuple
    - std::pair: pair of two things of differnt types (e.g. string, double)
    - std::tuple: list of variables of different types (e.g. string, 2 doubles)
    - idea: label items in memory to access (a "databox")
      - spec: access at runtime (keys are strings)
      - spectre: access at compile time (keys are types)
      - realize this: a DataBox is a tuple of pairs, first type labels item, second type is the type of the item's value
      - example: rectangle area
      - example: if missing tag, you get a compiler error
      - TaggedTuple version of the rectangle area example
  - Metaprogramming
    - brigand library
    - tmpl::list<>
    - printing types at runtime
    - printing types at compile time
    - integer arithmetic, boolean logic at compile time
