For meeting 12, please make sure you have the Guidelines Support Library available.

Here's one way to get it:

~~~
cd /some/path # replace /some/path with location where you clone GSL
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL
cd /path/to/meeting/codes # /path/to/meeting/codes -> place where you
                          # will write today's codes
# When including GSL, add `-I /some/path/GSL/include` to your compile command
~~~

Alternatively, the spectre docker container has it:
